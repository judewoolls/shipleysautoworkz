            <h2 id="about-title">Hi, I’m Charlie – founder of Shipley’s Autoworkz</h2>
            <p class="about-text">I opened the garage in 2024. I’m a passionate car
                enthusiast with a background in drifting and motorsport. After years of hands-on experience and a love
                for everything automotive, I launched Shipley’s Autoworkz to bring top-quality service and expertise to
                car owners in the Bow/copplestone and Crediton area.</p>
            <p class="about-text">Whether you need an MOT, brake or clutch repairs, engine replacements, recovery, or a
                call-out – I’ve got
                you covered. I work on all types of vehicles, from show cars to daily drivers, with the same care and
                attention I give my own.</p>
            <p class="about-text">Looking forward to helping you get back on the road – and keeping you there.</p>
